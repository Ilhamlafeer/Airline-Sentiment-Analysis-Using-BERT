🤖 Airline Tweet Sentiment Classification Using BERT
This project fine-tunes a pretrained **BERT (bert-base-uncased)** model to classify airline-related tweets as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**. It improves upon traditional NLP techniques by applying **transformer-based transfer learning** for better accuracy and generalization.

📌 Features
💬 **Text Preprocessing**
   Basic cleaning (e.g., lowercasing, URL removal)
   Hugging Face’s `BertTokenizer` used for subword tokenization and input formatting

🔧 **Model Fine-tuning**
   Used Hugging Face `Trainer` API with `BertForSequenceClassification`
   Fine-tuned on cleaned tweet dataset with 3 sentiment classes
   Configured training with:
     Learning rate: 2e-5
     Batch size: 16
     Epochs: 3
     Weight decay: 0.01

📊 **Training Monitoring**
   Integrated **Weights & Biases (wandb)** for experiment tracking and hyperparameter tuning

📈 **Evaluation**
    Accuracy: ~85.96%
    Evaluation Loss: ~0.47
    Evaluation Speed: ~146 samples/sec
    
🧠 Techniques Used
      **Transfer Learning** with pretrained BERT
      **Tokenization** with `BertTokenizer`
      **Fine-tuning** on a real-world dataset using Hugging Face Transformers
      **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Cross-Entropy Loss
      **Experiment Tracking** with wandb
  Optimized model for **limited hardware** (Google Colab + T4 GPU)

🔄 From Traditional NLP to Deep Learning with PyTorch
This project builds upon previous work where traditional NLP techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization combined with classical machine learning models (like Naive Bayes and Random Forest) were used for sentiment classification on the same dataset.
In this repository, I have fine-tuned a pretrained BERT model using PyTorch through the Hugging Face Transformers library.
